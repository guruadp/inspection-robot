# inspection-robot
This is the final Project for the Software Development for Robotics (ENPM808X) course. Turtlebot3 is navigated in a wearhouse to desired locations where items are placed. Each item is identified by the robot using a camera integrated with the robot that detects the ARUCO marker present in the box. Using this the classification of item is performed, and a report is generated to account for the available and the misplaced items.
